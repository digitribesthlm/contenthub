# n8n Workflow Architecture for Content Hub

This document outlines the complete n8n workflow architecture for the Content Hub application, including all webhook endpoints, JSON payload formats, AI integrations, MongoDB operations, and WordPress publishing.

## 1. Overview

The n8n workflow is the automation backbone of the Content Hub. It handles content creation, AI-powered enhancements, data storage, and publishing to WordPress. The workflow is triggered by three distinct webhooks, each with a specific purpose.

## 2. Webhook Endpoints

The application uses three webhook endpoints to trigger different n8n workflows. These are configured in your `.env.local` file.

| Webhook Variable            | Purpose                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_NEW_BRIEF`     | Creates a new content brief in MongoDB.  |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_PUBLISH`       | Publishes content to WordPress.          |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_SCHEDULE`      | Schedules content for future publication.|

## 3. Workflow Details

### 3.1. New Content Brief Workflow

This workflow is triggered when a user creates a new content brief in the app.

**Webhook:** `N8N_WEBHOOK_NEW_BRIEF`

**JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "id": "string", // Unique ID generated by the app (e.g., "w23434ksdfkdsfksdfsdf")
  "BriefID": "string", // Same as id - custom brief identifier for MongoDB
  "title": "string",
  "brief": "string",
  "domainId": "string",
  "clientId": "string",
  "createdAt": "string", // ISO 8601 date string
  "status": "Draft",
  "contentType": "Blog"
}
```

**Important:** The `BriefID` field should be stored in MongoDB as a separate field from the MongoDB `_id`. This allows you to have a custom identifier that is independent of MongoDB's internal ID system.

**Workflow Steps:**

1.  **Receive Webhook:** The workflow starts when it receives the JSON payload from the app.
2.  **Insert into MongoDB:** The payload is inserted as a new document into the `content_briefs` collection.
3.  **Return Response:** The newly created MongoDB document is returned to the app.

### 3.2. Publish Content Workflow

This workflow is triggered when a user clicks "Publish Now" on a content brief.

**Webhook:** `N8N_WEBHOOK_PUBLISH`

**JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "brief": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "contentType": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "clientId": "string",
  "domainId": "string",
  "heroImageUrl": "string",
  "heroImageData": "string | null", // Base64 encoded image if generated
  "createdAt": "string"
}
```

**Workflow Steps:**

1.  **Receive Webhook:** The workflow starts with the content brief data.
2.  **AI Content Enhancement (Optional):** You can add a step here to use an AI model (like Gemini) to refine or expand the content before publishing.
3.  **Generate Hero Image (if needed):** If `heroImageData` is null, use the Gemini API to generate a hero image based on the content.
4.  **Publish to WordPress:** The content, title, and hero image are published to the corresponding WordPress site.
5.  **Update MongoDB:** The status of the content brief is updated to `Published` in the `content_briefs` collection.

### 3.3. Schedule Content Workflow

This workflow is triggered when a user schedules a content brief for future publication.

**Webhook:** `N8N_WEBHOOK_SCHEDULE`

**JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "brief": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "contentType": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "clientId": "string",
  "domainId": "string",
  "heroImageUrl": "string",
  "heroImageData": "string | null",
  "scheduledAt": "string", // ISO 8601 date string
  "createdAt": "string"
}
```

**Workflow Steps:**

1.  **Receive Webhook:** The workflow starts with the content brief and schedule date.
2.  **Schedule Execution:** The workflow is scheduled to run at the specified `scheduledAt` time.
3.  **Publish to WordPress:** At the scheduled time, the content is published to WordPress.
4.  **Update MongoDB:** The status of the content brief is updated to `Published`.

## 4. AI Integration (Gemini)

The application uses the Gemini API for two main purposes:

1.  **Generate Hero Image:** Creates a hero image based on the content brief and brand guide style.
2.  **Edit Hero Image:** Modifies an existing hero image based on a user-provided prompt.

This is handled in the `geminiService.ts` file and can be integrated into your n8n workflows as needed.

## 5. MongoDB Integration

All content briefs, domains, and brand guides are stored in MongoDB. The n8n workflows are responsible for creating and updating these records.

## 6. WordPress Integration

The final step in the publishing and scheduling workflows is to publish the content to WordPress. This requires a WordPress integration in your n8n workflow that can create new posts with a title, content, and featured image.
